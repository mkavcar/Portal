<p>Pacing reports allow media planning teams to monitor the rate of trafficking against campaign plans. The primary goal of these reports is to indicate whether the campaign's budget is being spent evenly across the allotted time period. Multiple measures are provided as lenses into this how delivery unfolds for a given campaign, on a raw, running sum, and percentage basis. Some of the measures are as follows: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Days completed and remaining in a given campaign</li>
    <li>Impressions delivered vs planned</li>
    <li>Actual capped and uncapped cost vs planned</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note, all the reports have data available from 1/1/2015 to the prior day except for Moat whose data is available only from 5/1/2016.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Report Data Sources</h2>
<p>CCR uses the following data sources: </p>
<p><strong> Campaign Management: </strong> Prisma </p>
<p><strong> Primary Ad Servers: </strong> DFA &amp; Sizmek</p>
<p><strong> Campaign Verification: </strong> DoubleVerify &amp; Moat</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Report Types</h2>
<p>Due to the varying level of granularity of the reports, CCR provides these reports in four categories:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Summary Reports</h2>
<p>We provide summary reports for a high-level view of how each client’s trafficking is pacing by campaign, inventory type, and site. Because CCR’s data can be very dense at its most granular level, these reports provide superior performance when seeking to access it.</p>
<p>These reports include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Overall Pacing</li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Working with the reports - Downloaded Report Files</h2>
<p>This section covers some important information you must know about the downloaded reports. </p>
<p></p>
<p style="font-weight:bold">File Format</p>
<p>All report files downloaded from the CCR website are Excel Files. When the user opens the files for the first time, they will need to click on the “Enable Content” button that appears on top of the file.</p>

<p> Note: Make sure you have Excel 2013 to use these reports. Some functionality may not work if you have a lower version of Excel.</p>
<p>Note: On clicking the “Enable Content” button, the file will automatically refresh to display the client data the user has access to. For this automatic refresh to take place, make sure you’re on GroupM network or VPN. Please allow a moment for the report to fetch all of your data. </p>
<p>Note: Make sure you have approved access to the data.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Report Filters Worksheet</h2>

<p style="font-weight:bold">“Refresh Data” Button</p>
<p>The “Refresh Data” button helps you to refresh the reports to the latest available data. Clicking on this button will not reset your filters. The data is processed on a daily basis, and the latest data available at any time is 48 hours prior to the current date at launch. Overtime, we will aim to reduce this to a 24 hour window. </p>

<p style="font-weight:bold">“Clear Filters” Button</p>
<p>The “Clear Filters” button resets all selected filters. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2> Data Filter Parameters - Summary Reports </h2>
<p>Both Pacing and Performance Summary reports have the same filter parameters. Details of these parameters are given below:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Country</li>
  <li style="list-style-type:none;">This filter allows you to filter your clients by the country you manage. If you have access to clients in both US and Canada, this filter will show both buttons, otherwise, it will just show the one country your clients reside.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Calendar Year</li>
  <li style="list-style-type:none;">CCR contains Planned and Delivered for full year 2015 onwards, this filter allows you to view data for either one year or both years.  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Client </li>
  <li style="list-style-type:none;">This filter will contain a list of all clients you have access to. Select single or multiple clients depending on what client’s data you wish to view in the reports. </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2> Data Filter Parameters - Detailed Reports </h2>

</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Date Range</li>
  <li style="list-style-type:none;">Since these reports are more detailed, we have provided a date slider, which allows you to select monthly date ranges instead of just years. This will allow you to filter data further by days, months and quarters. Select a start and end date by expanding the selected portion of the slider across a date range. This filter allows you to view your data as detailed as a day to as high level as a year. The slider itself can be changed to select days, months, quarters or years.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Client </li>
  <li style="list-style-type:none;">This filter will contain a list of all clients you have access to. Select single or multiple clients depending on what client’s data you wish to view in the reports. </li>

          <li>Levels of aggregation higher than package may show Actual Uncapped Cost exceeding Planned Cost, while Actual Capped Cost is lower than Planned Cost, if some packages over-deliver while others under-deliver.</li>

                <p>Cost Capped:</p>
                <p>
                    This occurs at the package and flight level. Which means:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Capping will only occur when the budget for a package over the duration of its entire flight is exceeded.</li>
                        <li>Levels of aggregation higher than package may show Actual Uncapped Cost exceeding Planned Cost, while Actual Capped Cost is lower than Planned Cost, if some packages over-deliver while others under-deliver.</li>
                        <li>Placements in a package may show arbitrary over-delivery and under-delivery, while the entire package’s capped cost will not exceed the plan.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Because capping occurs at a package level, which may add complexity at lower or higher levels of aggregation, the most reliable way to monitor pacing is via the running sum reports.</p>
