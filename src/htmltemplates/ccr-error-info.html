<p>Exception reports highlight records that may require some attention from media planning teams. If spend or other measures in CCR’s report don’t match expectations, end users may want to check here to cross-reference CCR’s more granular data against other data sources. </p>
<p> For instance, if a particular placement doesn’t appear in a performance report, you may want to check the Date Capped exception report to determine if that placement’s delivery occurred outside of the planned flight period. Alternately, you can check the Prisma Orphan exception report to determine that no data was received from DCM or Sizmek.</p>
<p> In many cases, these records represent normal planning and trafficking activity. For instance, planned records without delivery may simply represent campaign planning for future months. Spend-capped records are provided as a reference, to identify when delivered costs exceeded the plan for given placements and creatives in a package. </p>
<p> In other cases, adjustments may be needed. For instance, date capped records may represent a need to update package flight start dates in Prisma.</p>

<p>Please note, all the reports have data available from 1/1/2015 to the prior day except for Moat whose data is available only from 5/1/2016.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Report Data Sources</h2>
<p>CCR uses the following data sources: </p>
<p><strong> Campaign Management Tool: </strong> Prisma </p>
<p><strong> Primary Ad Servers: </strong> DFA &amp; Sizmek</p>
<p><strong> Campaign Verification: </strong> DoubleVerify &amp; Moat</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Report Types</h2>
<p>The Exception Report workbook is separated into four worksheets. Each worksheet returns rows where the given exception was observed.</p>
<p>Please note, future versions of CCR will also include Ad Server only records as well that don’t correspond to any campaign management data.</p>
<p>These reports share the same definition. <a href="#exception">Click here</a> for details on the report definition. A summary of the four exception reports given below: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Prisma Orphans</li>
    <li style="list-style-type:none;">
        Campaign management data with no corresponding data from an ad server or other performance source.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Cost-Capped</li>
    <li style="list-style-type:none;"> Rows where spend – aggregated for all placements and creatives in a given package by day – exceeds the plan for a given package. The planned budget for a package is the sum of each month’s planned budget over the duration of a package’s flight period. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Date-Capped</li>
    <li style="list-style-type:none;">Rows where delivery has occurred before a package’s flight start date, or after a package’s flight end date. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Zero Impressions</li>
    <li style="list-style-type:none;">Rows where delivered impressions from any source are less than or equal to zero. </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Working with the reports - Downloaded Report Files</h2>
<p>This section covers some important information you must know about the downloaded reports. </p>
<p></p>
<p style="font-weight:bold">File Format</p>
<p>All report files downloaded from the CCR website are Excel Files. When the user opens the files for the first time, they will need to click on the “Enable Content” button that appears on top of the file.</p>

<p> Note: Make sure you have Excel 2013 to use these reports. Some functionality may not work if you have a lower version of Excel.</p>
<p>Note: On clicking the “Enable Content” button, the file will automatically refresh to display the client data the user has access to. For this automatic refresh to take place, make sure you’re on GroupM network or VPN. Please allow a moment for the report to fetch all of your data. </p>
<p>Note: Make sure you have approved access to the data.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Report Filters Worksheet</h2>

<p style="font-weight:bold">“Refresh Data” Button</p>
<p>The “Refresh Data” button helps you to refresh the reports to the latest available data. Clicking on this button will not reset your filters. The data is processed on a daily basis, and the latest data available at any time is 48 hours prior to the current date at launch. Overtime, we will aim to reduce this to a 24 hour window. </p>

<p style="font-weight:bold">“Clear Filters” Button</p>
<p>The “Clear Filters” button resets all selected filters. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2> Data Filter Parameters - Exception Reports </h2>
<p>Details of the filter parameters are given below:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Country</li>
  <li style="list-style-type:none;">This filter allows you to filter your clients by the country you manage. If you have access to clients in both US and Canada, this filter will show both buttons, otherwise, it will just show the one country your clients reside.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Date Range</li>
  <li style="list-style-type:none;">Since these reports are more detailed, we have provided a date slider, which allows you to select monthly date ranges instead of just years. This will allow you to filter data further by days, months and quarters. Select a start and end date by expanding the selected portion of the slider across a date range. This filter allows you to view your data as detailed as a day to as high level as a year. The slider itself can be changed to select days, months, quarters or years.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Client </li>
  <li style="list-style-type:none;">This filter will contain a list of all clients you have access to. Select single or multiple clients depending on what client’s data you wish to view in the reports. </li>
</ul>

          <li>Levels of aggregation higher than package may show Actual Uncapped Cost exceeding Planned Cost, while Actual Capped Cost is lower than Planned Cost, if some packages over-deliver while others under-deliver.</li>
          <li>Placements in a package may show arbitrary over-delivery and under-delivery, while the entire package’s capped cost will not exceed the plan.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Because capping occurs at a package level, which may add complexity at lower or higher levels of aggregation, the most reliable way to monitor pacing is via the running sum reports.</p>
